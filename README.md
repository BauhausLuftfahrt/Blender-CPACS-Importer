# CPACS import addon for Blender

Import CPACS xml files directly into Blender and turn them into a detailed 3D fuselage and cabin model. With already applied textures, lights and cameras you are ready to go for high quality renders of your cabin and fuselage design. 

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline.
